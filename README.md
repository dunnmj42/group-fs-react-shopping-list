# React Shopping List

## Description

_Duration: Group React Project_

This is shopping list full-stack app from scratch.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Installation

1. Create a SQL database named `react_shopping_list`
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables. The INSERT statement will populate the table with dummy data if you'd like to see how the todo-list looks with data already inserted. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install` in the terminal
4. Run `npm install pg`
5. Run `npm install axios`
6. Run `npm run server` 
7. Run `npm run client` and visit localhost:3000 in your browser
